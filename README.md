UIBox has a 12 columns grid system which is flexible enough to form your desired layout. UIBox Grid has two different classes, `row` and `col-*`. You can use `row` to create a new row for you layout. While `col-*` is use to make your columns. As UIBox Grid is a 12-columns layout you can choose between various column numbers based on your needs.

```html
<div class="col-12"></div>
<div class="col-6"></div>
<div class="col-4"></div>
<div class="col-3"></div>
<div class="col-1"></div>
```

In addition to normal sizes, UIBox also support some meaningful classes which help you build your layout semantically.

```html
<div class="col-half"></div>
<div class="col-third"></div>
<div class="col-two-thirds"></div>
<div class="col-quarter"></div>
```
